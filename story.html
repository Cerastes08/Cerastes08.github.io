		<h1>The Story So Far<br>----------------------------------------</h1>

		<p class="left">
			On January 4th, 1963, scarcely a month after the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Earth itself shook, registering as a low magnitude earthquake the world over. This event has since been termed “The Awakening” and on that day, 13 individuals across the world gained superhuman abilities. These 13 individuals greatly impacted the regions they lived in, and the world as a whole, as they all were not simply powerful, they were incredibly so. Just as the world slowly got used to their new normal, it changed again, however. Some time during 1978, 15 years after The Awakening, people across the world began awakening to powers, although only after experiencing truly momentous, usually incredibly traumatic, events, which were called “Shatterpoints”. This influx of powers brought about great reform, as governments across the world scrambled to create departments and bureaucracies to manage their new, superhuman population.
			The addition of superhuman abilities, and especially the 2 members of the original 13 residing there, allowed the Soviet Union to avoid collapse, and remain as a superpower roughly equal to the United States, even till the modern day. In the following decades, it also became apparent that if those who had awakened powers had children, their children would inherit some variation of their parents powers. This resulted in several horrific experiments in attempts to increase the superhuman population, but none truly succeeded in their goal. However, this trend does not seem to be stopping, and the ratio of powered individuals (PIs) to normal humans is slowly increasing.

		<h1>Power Classifications<br>----------------------------------------</h1>

		<p class="left">
			Powers are separated into 12 categories, both to make it easy to categorize PIs, as well as to improve response times against unknown threats. (easier to call out “Blaster” than it is to explain that the crazy man in a jumpsuit can fire lasers from his eyes) While some PIs fit neatly into a single category, it is not uncommon to fit into several, in which case all apply and can be referenced as necessary.

		<dl>
			<dt>Mover:</dt>
			<dd>Any ability that enhances movement. (Flight, superspeed, etc.)</dd>
			<dt>Shaker:</dt>
			<dd>Abilities with large AOE, typically not originating specifically from the user. (Spatial and gravity manipulation, large scale temperature control, etc.)</dd>
			<dt>Brute:</dt>
			<dd> Anything that makes the user harder to harm or physically stronger. (Metal/stone forms, super strength, invulnerability, etc.)</dd>
			<dt>Breaker:</dt>
			<dd>Harder to pin down exactly, but generally used for forms that break the laws of the universe, when you turn into smoke, you don't have a brain, yet are still thinking. That’s a breaker ability.</dd>
			<dt>Master:</dt>
			<dd>Any PI able to control or manipulate others, be they humans or other creatures. Some masters can summon controlled minions, others can manipulate humans, and others just control animals around them.</dd>
			<dt>Tinker:</dt>
			<dd>All those “supergenius” characters would be classified as tinkers. Their abilities allow them to make tech no one else can, and generally follows a specialization, be that miniaturization, autonomous robots, or even biology.</dd>
			<dt>Blaster:</dt>
			<dd>Any long range attack originating from the user. (Throwing fireballs, shooting lasers, etc.)</dd>
			<dt>Thinker:</dt>
			<dd>Abilities that enhance the mind of PI in some way, be that super deduction, mind reading, or precognition.</dd>
			<dt>Striker:</dt>
			<dd>Like blaster, but touch range, a striker might impart great velocity onto people and things they touch, or perhaps even kill or control someone with a touch.</dd>
			<dt>Changer:</dt>
			<dd>For all the shapeshifters and PIs with alternate forms, be that getting big and strong, or turning into an animal, or being a doppelganger.</dd>
			<dt>Trump:</dt>
			<dd>Any power that affects other powers, be that granting powers, temporary or permanent, nullifying powers, or enhancing powers, you get the idea.</dd>
			<dt>Stranger:</dt>
			<dd>Another harder one to pin down, but largely fits into subterfuge based abilities, like invisibility, or being unable to be perceived or thought of in certain ways. I think illusions also count in here.</dd>
